def detect_lines(img, sigma, threshold, numLines):
    """
    Detects lines in a color or grayscale image using the a custom implementation of the Hough transform.

    Parameters:
    img (numpy.ndarray): The input image.
    sigma (float): The standard deviation of the Gaussian blur applied to the image.
    threshold (int): The low threshold value used for Canny edge detection. The high threshold is twice this value.
    numLines (int): The maximum number of lines to detect.

    Returns:
    list: A list of tuples representing the detected lines. Each tuple contains
        two values: rho and theta, where rho is the distance from the origin to
        the line and theta is the angle between the x-axis and the normal to the line.
